# This is a local configuration file template for the LVM2 system
# which should be installed as @DEFAULT_SYS_DIR@/lvmlocal.conf .
#
# This file allows you to assign a unique identity to a host running
# LVM2 that is permitted to access storage devices visible to more than
# one machine simultaneously.  
#
# You must ensure that every such host uses a different system_id
# identifier, otherwise LVM2 cannot protect you from simultaneous
# access from multiple hosts and possible data corruption.
#
# Refer to 'man lvmsystemid' for information about the correct ways
# to use this and its limitations.
#
# Refer to 'man lvm.conf' for information about the file layout.
#
# To put this file in a different directory and override
# @DEFAULT_SYS_DIR@ set the environment variable LVM_SYSTEM_DIR before
# running the tools.
#
# The lvmlocal.conf file is normally expected to contain only the
# "local" section which contains settings that should not be shared or
# repeated among different hosts.  (But if other sections are present,
# they *will* get processed.  Settings in this file override equivalent
# ones in lvm.conf and are in turn overridden by ones in any enabled
# lvm_<tag>.conf files.)
#
# Please take care that each setting only appears once if uncommenting
# example settings in this file and never copy this file between
# hosts to avoid accidentally assigning the same system ID to
# more than one host!

local {
    # This defines the system ID of the local host.  This is used
    # when global/system_id_source is set to "lvmlocal" in the main
    # configuration file, conventionally @DEFAULT_SYS_DIR@/lvm.conf.  
    # When used, it must be set to a unique value - often a hostname -
    # across all the hosts sharing access to the storage.
    #
    # By default, no system_id is set.
    # system_id = ""
    #
    # Set the system_id to the string "host1".
    # system_id = "host1"

    # This defines a list of extra system_ids other than the local
    # system_id that the local host is allowed to access.  These are
    # used for all values of global/system_id_source except "none".
    #
    # Only use this if you have read 'man lvmsystemid' and you are sure
    # you understand why you need to use it!
